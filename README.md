1-Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of a clothes store using data analysis techniques. The analysis involves extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from Excel files to SQL Server, creating a data warehouse (DWH), and building relationships between fact and dimension tables. The data is then queried to obtain key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights, followed by creating views and stored procedures. Finally, the data is visualized using Power BI.


2-ETL Process
The ETL process involves the following steps:
Extract: Extract data from Excel files.
Transform: Cleanse and transform the data to fit the database schema.
Load: Load the transformed data into SQL Server.


3-Data Warehouse Design
The data warehouse is designed to facilitate efficient querying and analysis. The schema includes fact and dimension tables.
Steps:
Create a star schema with fact and dimension tables.
Establish relationships between the fact and dimension tables.
Tables:
Fact Table: Contains quantitative data for analysis (e.g., sales data).
Dimension Tables: Contains descriptive attributes related to dimensions (orders., products, customers, date).


4-SQL Queries for KPIs and Insights
SQL queries are written to extract KPIs and insights from the data warehouse.
Steps:
Write SQL queries to calculate various KPIs (e.g., total sales, average order value).
Generate insights by analyzing trends and patterns in the data.


5-Views and Stored Procedures
To simplify data access and analysis, views and stored procedures are created.
Steps:
Create views to provide a simplified and abstracted view of the data.
Develop stored procedures to automate and encapsulate complex queries.


6-Power BI Visualization
Power BI is used to create interactive and insightful visualizations.
Steps:
Connect Power BI to the SQL Server database.
Create visualizations such as charts, graphs, and dashboards
